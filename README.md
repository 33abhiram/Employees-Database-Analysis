# Employees Database Analysis

## Project Goal
I analyzed a sample employees dataset comprising around 1 million rows of salary data since I was curious about the general factors that affect an employee's salary in a company. To find answers, I used my data analysis knowledge in SQL combined with data visualization in tableau to create an Interactive Dashboard that showcases some of the factors that affect an employee's salary.

## Data Dictionary
employees.zip contains the employees.sql file that loads the data for all tables in the employees database.


## Results
The results of my meticulous data analysis show that an employee's position, age and department affect their salary the most. Employees who are managers and senior staff members and ones that work in marketing and sales department earn higher salaries.
Through this project, I provide my audience with a general understanding of the drivers behind employee pay, and most importantly, understand the primary concepts of data science like data mining, data analysis and data modelling.
